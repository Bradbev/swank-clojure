Instructions for use:

  1. First you need to have the latest SVN copy of clojure and the
     latest CVS version of slime (this has been untested for any
     other version). (Latest as of 2008-05-08)

  2. Use a script that will start clojure while providing java a
     pid, name it "clojure", and place it in your PATH. If no pid
     is provided, swank-clojure will fallback on JDK
     implementation specific methods of getting the pid. It may
     not work on other JVMs.

     For an example of a script that does this, see
     sh-script/clojure in the clojure-extra repository at:
        http://clojure.codestuffs.com/

     If this is not possible, you must edit swank-clojure.el and
     change the slime-lisp-implementations.

  3. If you haven't already, set the default lisp to load for
     slime via slime-lisp-implementations. If you want the default
     to be clojure, you may skip this step.

     Example for sbcl:
       (setq slime-lisp-implementations '((sbcl "sbcl")))

  4. Add to your .emacs
       (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/swank-clojure")
       (require 'swank-clojure)

  5. Start slime by:
      M-- M-x slime clojure


This is a preliminary version that doesn't support several slime
features, but I'm working on it...

Known issues:
 - Missing inspection, debugging, and a few other slime functions
